Thinkful - Data Science in Python. Unit 2 Lesson 5.2

Up to this point we've been using a reduced version of the Lending Club loan data. For this task, we're going to use the full dataset to illustrate multivariate analysis more fully. While the column names are a little different, the underlying data is exactly the same.

Load the Lending Club Statistics.
Use income (annual_inc) to model interest rates (int_rate).
Add home ownership (home_ownership) to the model.
Does that affect the significance of the coefficients in the original model?
Try to add the interaction of home ownership and incomes as a term. How does this impact the new model?
